## What is searXNG?

SearXNG is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from various search services and databases. Users are neither tracked nor profiled.

## What is this extension good for?

It allows setting a specific searXNG instance as your default search engine in Firefox.

## For which instances do extensions exist?

For some reliable instances (see https://searx.space/) that exist for a longer time and are somehow reliable (see https://github.com/ndsvw/SearXNG-Instances-Age#output).

## Is this the OFFICIAL extension for instance XY?

No. The extension(s) is/are built based on a common source code that allows generating Firefox extensions for searXNG quickly.

## Why not creating one single extension for all searXNG instances?

Because Firefox does not allow a dynamic search engine host that can be modified by the user.
It has to be static when the extension is built. ü§∑üèª
